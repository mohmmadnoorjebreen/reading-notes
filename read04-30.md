# Hashtables

## What is a Hashtable?

A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose.

A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable.

A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

### Why do we use them?
 
Hold unique values

### What Are they

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. 

### Structure 

Hashing:  basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. Itâ€™s very important that hash codes are deterministic

Creating a Hash

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.

```
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 
```

Collisions

A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. 

Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one.

```
hashMap.Add("Pioneer Square", 98104);
hashMap.Add("Alki Beach", 98116);
```
`Bucket 92: [{Pioneer Square: 98104} --> {Alki Beach: 98116}]`
