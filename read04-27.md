# Using models

Django allows you to define relationships that are one to one (OneToOneField), one to many (ForeignKey) and many to many (ManyToManyField).

Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata.

from django.db import models

```
class MyModelName(models.Model):
    """A typical class defining a model, derived from the Model class."""

    # Fields
    my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')
    ...

    # Metadata
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-my_field_name']

    # Methods
    def get_absolute_url(self):
        """Returns the url to access a particular instance of MyModelName."""
        return reverse('model-detail-view', args=[str(self.id)])

    def __str__(self):
        """String for representing the MyModelName object (in Admin site etc.)."""
        return self.my_field_name
```

## Fields 

A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables.

`my_field_name = models.CharField(max_length=20, help_text='Enter field documentation')`

max_length=20 — States that the maximum length of a value in this field is 20 characters.

help_text='Enter field documentation' — provides a text label to display to help users know what value to provide when this value is to be entered by a user via an HTML form.

### Common field arguments

1. help_text

2. verbose_name

3. default

4. null

### Common field types

1. CharField
2. TextField
3. IntegerField
4. DateField

# Django admin site

## Registering models 

First, open admin.py in the catalog application (/locallibrary/catalog/admin.py).

```
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.
```

Register the models by copying the following text into the bottom of the file.

```
from .models import Author, Genre, Book, BookInstance

admin.site.register(Book)
admin.site.register(Author)
admin.site.register(Genre)
admin.site.register(BookInstance)
```

## Creating a superuser 

Call the following command, in the same directory as manage.py, to create the superuser. 

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

`python3 manage.py runserver`

## Logging in and using the site 

To login to the site, open the /admin URL (e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin) and enter your new superuser userid and password credentials.
