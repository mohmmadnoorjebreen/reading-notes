# How to Web Scrape with Python 

## Web Scraping 

Web scraping is a technique to automatically access and extract large amounts of information from a website.

## Important notes about web scraping:

1- Read through the website’s Terms and Conditions to understand how you can legally use the data.

2- Make sure you are not downloading data at too rapid a rate because this may break the website. 

## Python Code 

```
import requests
import urllib.request
import time
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```

```
url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html'
response = requests.get(url)
```

`soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, “html.parser”)`

`soup.findAll('a')`

```
one_a_tag = soup.findAll(‘a’)[38]
link = one_a_tag[‘href’]
```

```
download_url = 'http://web.mta.info/developers/'+ link
urllib.request.urlretrieve(download_url,'./'+link[link.find('/turnstile_')+1:])
```

`time.sleep(1)`

## What is Web Scraping? 

Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites.

## How to scrape websites without getting blocked 

- Respect Robots.txt 

- Make the crawling slower, do not slam the server, treat websites nicely


- Do not follow the same crawling pattern


- Make requests through Proxies and rotate them as needed


- Rotate User Agents and corresponding HTTP Request Headers between requests

- Use a headless browser like Puppeteer, Selenium or Playwright

- Check if Website is Changing Layouts

- Avoid scraping data behind a login

- Use Captcha Solving Services
