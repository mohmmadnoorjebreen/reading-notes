# Python Scope

he scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name.

Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.


Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

 When you can access the value of a given name from someplace in your code, you’ll say that the name is in scope. If you can’t access the name, then you’ll say that the name is out of scope.

## Modules: The Global Scope 

Python turns your program’s main script into a module called __main__ to hold the main program’s execution.

To inspect the names within your main global scope, you can use dir(). If you call dir() without arguments

```
>>> dir()
['__annotations__', '__builtins__',..., '__package__', '__spec__']
>>> var = 100  # Assign var at the top level of __main__
>>> dir()
['__annotations__', '__builtins__',..., '__package__', '__spec__', 'var']
```

You can access or reference the value of any global name from any place in your code. 

```
>>> var = 100
>>> def func():
...     return var  # You can access var from inside func()
...
>>> func()
100
>>> var  # Remains unchanged
100
```

## The global Statement

The statement consists of the global keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. 
```
>>> counter = 0  # A global name
>>> def update_counter():
...     counter = counter + 1  # Fail trying to update counter
...
>>> update_counter()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in update_counter
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'counter' referenced before assignment
```
## nonlocal scope
Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions.
```
>>> def outer_func():
...     # This block is the Local scope of outer_func()
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal var
...     # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
...     def inner_func():
...         # This block is the Local scope of inner_func()
...         print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
...
...     inner_func()
...     print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
...
>>> outer_func()
Printing var from inner_func(): 100
Printing var from outer_func(): 100
>>> inner_func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'inner_func' is not defined
```
## The nonlocal Statement

Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. 
With a nonlocal statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.
```
>>> def func():
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal variable
...     def nested():
...         nonlocal var  # Declare var as nonlocal
...         var += 100
...
...     nested()
...     print(var)
...
>>> func()
200
```
