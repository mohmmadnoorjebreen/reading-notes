## Django Custum User Model

Django ships with a built-in User model for authentication and if you'd like a basic tutorial on how to implement log in, log out, sign up.

using a custom user model instead. This provides far more flexibility down the line.

### AbstractUser vs AbstractBaseUser

There are two modern ways to create a custom user model in Django: AbstractUser and AbstractBaseUser.

So we'll use AbstractUser which actually subclasses AbstractBaseUser but provides more default configuration.

### Custom User Model

Creating our initial custom user model requires four steps:


1. update config/settings.py
2. create a new CustomUser model
3. create new UserCreation and UserChangeForm
3. update the admin

In settings.py we'll add the accounts app and use the AUTH_USER_MODEL config to tell Django to use our new custom user model in place 

```
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'accounts', # new
]
...
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser' # new
```

Now update accounts/models.py with a new User model which we'll call CustomUser.

```
# accounts/models.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
from django.db import models

class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
    pass
    # add additional fields in here

    def __str__(self):
        return self.username
```

### Superuser

It's helpful to create a superuser that we can use to log in to the admin and test out log in/log out. 

`python manage.py createsuperuser`
