# Matplotlib Tutorial

matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. 

## IPython and the pylab mode

IPython is an enhanced interactive Python shell that has lots of interesting features including named inputs and outputs, access to shell commands.

pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library.

## Simple plot

In this section, we want to draw the cosine and sine functions on the same plot.

The first step is to get the data for the sine and cosine functions:

```
import numpy as np

X = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 256, endpoint=True)
C, S = np.cos(X), np.sin(X)
```

To run the example

`$ python exercice_1.py`

### Using defaults

Matplotlib comes with a set of default settings that allow customizing all kinds of properties.

### Instantiating defaults

In the script below, we've instantiated

### Changing colors and line widths

```
...
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6), dpi=80)
plt.plot(X, C, color="blue", linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
plt.plot(X, S, color="red",  linewidth=2.5, linestyle="-")
...
```

### Setting ticks

Current ticks are not ideal because they do not show the interesting values (+/-π,+/-π/2) for sine and cosine.

```
...
plt.xticks( [-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi])
plt.yticks([-1, 0, +1])
...
```

### Setting tick labels

![](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib-tutorial/raw/master/figures/exercice_6.png)

Ticks are now properly placed but their label is not very explicit. 

```
...
plt.xticks([-np.pi, -np.pi/2, 0, np.pi/2, np.pi],
       [r'$-\pi$', r'$-\pi/2$', r'$0$', r'$+\pi/2$', r'$+\pi$'])

plt.yticks([-1, 0, +1],
       [r'$-1$', r'$0$', r'$+1$'])
...
```

There are many things that can be controlled, such as:

1- Moving spines


2- Adding a legend

3- Annotate some points

4- Devil is in the details
