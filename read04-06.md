# How to use Random Module

## When to use it?
We want the computer to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list

## Random functions 

### Randint
If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters:

```
import random
print random.randint(0, 5)
This will output either 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.
```

### Random
If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

```
import random
random.random() * 100
```

### Choice 

Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

```
import random
myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
random.choice(myList)
```

### Shuffle

The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

```from random import shuffle
x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
shuffle(x)
Output:
# print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]
# of course your results will vary
```

### Randrange
Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)

```
import random
for i in range(3):
    print random.randrange(0, 101, 5)
```

# What is Risk Analysis in Software Testing and how to perform it?

risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test.

## Why use Risk Analysis?

it helps the developers and managers to mitigate the risks

what could be the possible risks

1- Use of new hardware

2- Use of new technology

3- Use of new automation tool

4- The sequence of code

5-  Availability of test resources for the application

Following points can be taken care of:

1- Conduct Risk Assessment review meeting

2- Use maximum resources to work on high-risk areas

3- Create a Risk Assessment database for future use

## Risk Identification

There are different sets of risks 

- Business Risks: This risk is the most common risk associated with our topic.

- Testing Risks: You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on,

- Software Risks: You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process.
