# Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

## Encrypting a message 

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:

`YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK`

That looks an awfully lot like gobbledygook at first, but this encrypted message is actually very related to the original text.

## Decrypting a message
 
According to historical records, Caesar always used a shift of 3. As long as his message recipient knew the shift amount, it was trivial for them to decode the message.

Imagine Caesar sends this message to a comrade:

`EHZDUH EUXWXV`

## Cracking the cipher

Imagine that a very literate and savvy enemy intercepts one of Caesar's messages.

```
RZ VMZ WMDIBDIB VGG AJMXZN OJ EJDI RDOC XGZJKVOMV OJ YZAZVO OCZ ZIZHT LPZZI VO OCZ IDGZ YZGOV
```

That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.

# Caesar cipher

It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
