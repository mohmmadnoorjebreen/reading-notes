# Trees

Common Terminology

1- Node 

2- Root 

3- K - A

4 - Left 

5- Right 

6- Edge 

7 - Leaf 

8 - Height

Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree

There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

Depth First
Breadth First

## Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first.

```
re-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A
```

## Pre-order
```
ALGORITHM preOrder(root)

  OUTPUT <-- root.value

  if root.left is not NULL
      preOrder(root.left)

  if root.right is not NULL
      preOrder(root.right)

```

Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first

## Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

`Output: A, B, C, D, E, F`


## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows. Here is what a binary tree looks like

## K-ary Trees

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree.
