# Python Regular Expressions Tutorial

## Regular Expressions in Python

n Python, regular expressions are supported by the re module. That means that if you want to start using them in your Python scripts, you have to import this module with the help of import:

## Basic Patterns: Ordinary Characters

You can easily tackle many basic patterns in Python using ordinary characters. Ordinary characters are the simplest regular expressions. 

Examples are `'A', 'a', 'X', '5'.`

```
pattern = r"Cookie"
sequence = "Cookie"
if re.match(pattern, sequence):
    print("Match!")
else: print("Not a match!")
```
The match() function returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None.

`r`=>This is called a raw string literal. It changes how the string literal is interpreted. Such literals are stored as they appear.

## Wild Card Characters: Special Characters

Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression.

. - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.

`re.search(r'Co.k.e', 'Cookie').group()`

^ - A caret. Matches the start of the string.

`re.search(r'^Eat', "Eat cake!").group()`

$ - Matches the end of string.

`re.search(r'cake$', "Cake! Let's eat cake").group()`

## Repetitions

`+ -` Checks if the preceding character appears one or more times starting from that position.

`re.search(r'Co+kie', 'Cooookie').group()`

`* - `Checks if the preceding character appears zero or more times starting from that position.

`re.search(r'Ca*o*kie', 'Cookie').group()`

## Grouping in Regular Expressions

The group feature of regular expression allows you to pick up parts of the matching text. Parts of a regular expression pattern bounded by parenthesis () are called groups. 

# shutil 

## shutil — High-level File Operations
The shutil module includes high-level file operations such as copying and archiving.



### Copying Files
copyfile() copies the contents of the source to the destination and raises IOError if it does not have permission to write to the destination file.

```
import glob
import shutil

print('BEFORE:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))

shutil.copyfile('shutil_copyfile.py', 'shutil_copyfile.py.copy')

print('AFTER:', glob.glob('shutil_copyfile.*'))
```
### Finding Files 

The which() function scans a search path looking for a named file.

```
import shutil

print(shutil.which('virtualenv'))
print(shutil.which('tox'))
print(shutil.which('no-such-program'))
```
### Archives 
Python’s standard library includes many modules for managing archive files such as tarfile and zipfile.
```
import shutil

for format, description in shutil.get_archive_formats():
    print('{:<5}: {}'.format(format, description))

```
