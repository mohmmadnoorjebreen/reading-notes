# Chapter 1: Bird's Eye View
Generally speaking, we can break down applied machine learning into the following chunks:

## Machine Learning ≠ Algorithms

Machine learning is not about algorithms.

Machine learning is a comprehensive approach to solving problems...

## What makes machine learning so special?


Machine learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

## Key Terminology

Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluating model performance.

Features - Variables (columns) in the dataset used to train the model.

Target variable - A specific variable you're trying to predict.

Observations - Data points (rows) in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Tasks
Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.

### Supervised Learning

In practice, it's often used as an advanced form of predictive modeling.

Classification is the task for modeling categorical (a.k.a. "class") target variables.

### Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning includes tasks for "unlabeled" data (i.e. you do not have a target variable).

Clustering is the most common unsupervised learning task, and it's for finding groups within your data.

# Chapter 2: Exploratory Analysis

There’s a big challenge in data science called “Tactical Hell.” This is actually a term from startups, and it’s when you have too many tactics to choose from:

There’s a lot of trial and error, so how do you avoid chasing dead ends? The answer is “Exploratory Analysis.” (Which is just fancy-talk for “getting to know” your data.)
