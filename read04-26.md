# How Django Works Behind the Scenes

Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram.

source packages have some degree of funding involved, typically in one of three forms:

1. Corporate Sponsor - A group of engineers within a larger, for-profit company decide to open-source internal code.
2. Solo - An individual developer initially creates code, open sources it, and retains default control.
3. Non-profit - This was Django’s approach early on, in 2008, when the Django Software Foundation was formed to promote, support, and advance Django.

## Django Software Foundation

The DSF supports and maintains Django in a number of capacities. 

## Technical Organization

The DSF handles legal, financial, and administrative matters for Django. But there is a separate organizational structure for the technical team.
