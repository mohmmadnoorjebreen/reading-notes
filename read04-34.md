##  Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices 

### Managing Django Settings: Issues

Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc

You need an approach that allows you to keep all these Django setting configurations.

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. 

Sharing settings between team members. You need a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings.

Django settings are a Python code. This is a curse and a blessing at the same time. It gives you a lot of flexibility

### Setting Configuration: Different Approaches


The basic idea of this method is to extend all environment-specific settings in the settings_local.py file, which is ignored by VCS. Here’s an example:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}
```

### Cons:

settings_local.py is not in VCS, so you can lose some of your Django environment settings.

## SSH Tutorial

### What is SSH

SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet.

The Figure Below shows a typical SSH Window.

## How Does SSH Work

If you’re using Linux or Mac, then using SSH is very simple. If you use Windows, you will need to utilize an SSH client to open SSH connections.

The SSH key command instructs your system that you want to open an encrypted Secure Shell Connection.
