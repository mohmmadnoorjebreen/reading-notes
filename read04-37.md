## ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

## Variable declaration

ES6 introduced the let keyword, which allows for block-scoped variables which cannot be hoisted or redeclared

```
var x = 0

let x = 0
```

## Constant declaration

ES6 introduced the const keyword, which cannot be redeclared or reassigned, but is not immutable.

`const CONST_IDENTIFIER = 0 // constants are uppercase by convention`

## Arrow functions

The arrow function expression syntax is a shorter way of creating a function expression. Arrow functions do not have their own this

```
function func(a, b, c) {} // function declaration
var func = function (a, b, c) {} // function expression
```

## Concatenation/string interpolation

Expressions can be embedded in template literal strings.

let str = `Release Date: ${date}`

## Destructuring (object matching)

Use curly brackets to assign properties of an object to their own variable.

`var obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}`

## Classes/constructor functions

```
function Func(a, b) {
  this.a = a
  this.b = b
}

Func.prototype.getSum = function () {
  return this.a + this.b
}

var x = new Func(3, 4)
```
