# What is Jupyter Lab

JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible.

You can arrange multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splitters. 

JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats. 

# NumPy Tutorial: Data Analysis with Python

NumPy is a commonly used Python data analysis package. By using NumPy, you can speed up your workflow.

## Lists Of Lists for CSV Data

We can read in the file using the csv.reader object.

```
import csv
with open('winequality-red.csv', 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=';'))
```
```
print(wines[:3])
```
```
[['fixed acidity', 'volatile acidity', 'citric acid', 'residual sugar', 'chlorides', 'free sulfur dioxide', 'total sulfur dioxide', 'density', 'pH', 'sulphates', 'alcohol', 'quality'], ['7.4', '0.7', '0', '1.9', '0.076', '11', '34', '0.9978', '3.51', '0.56', '9.4', '5'], ['7.8', '0.88', '0', '2.6', '0.098', '25', '67', '0.9968', '3.2', '0.68', '9.8', '5']]
```    

The data has been read into a list of lists.

## Numpy 2-Dimensional Arrays

with NumPy, we work with multidimensional arrays. 

A 2-dimensional array is also known as a matrix

## Creating A NumPy Array

We can create a NumPy array using the numpy.array function. 

 Because we want to be able to do computations like find the average quality of the wines, we need the elements to all be floats.

 ```
import csv
with open("winequality-red.csv", 'r') as f:
    wines = list(csv.reader(f, delimiter=";"))
import numpy as np
wines = np.array(wines[1:], dtype=np.float)
 ```
If we display wines, we’ll now get a NumPy array:

`wines`

```
array([[ 7.4 , 0.7 , 0. , ..., 0.56 , 9.4 , 5. ],
[ 7.8 , 0.88 , 0. , ..., 0.68 , 9.8 , 5. ],
[ 7.8 , 0.76 , 0.04 , ..., 0.65 , 9.8 , 5. ],
...,
[ 6.3 , 0.51 , 0.13 , ..., 0.75 , 11. , 6. ],
[ 5.9 , 0.645, 0.12 , ..., 0.71 , 10.2 , 5. ],
[ 6. , 0.31 , 0.47 , ..., 0.66 , 11. , 6. ]])
```
We can check the number of rows and columns in our data using the shape property of NumPy arrays:

`wines.shape`

`(1599, 12)

## Alternative NumPy Array Creation Methods

There are a variety of methods that you can use to create NumPy arrays.

you can create an array where every element is zero.

`import numpy as np`

```
empty_array = np.zeros((3,4))

empty_array
```

It’s useful to create an array with all zero elements in cases when you need an array of fixed size.

`np.random.rand(3,4)`

```
array([[ 0.2247223 , 0.92240549, 0.14541893, 0.61731257],
[ 0.00154957, 0.82342197, 0.74044906, 0.11466845],
[ 0.6152478 , 0.14433138, 0.13009583, 0.22981301]])
```
