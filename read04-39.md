## What is React context?

React context allows us to pass down and use (consume) data in whatever component we need in our React app without using props.

## When should you use React context?


React context is great when you are passing data that can be used in any component in your application.

- These types of data include:

1.  Theme data (like dark or light mode)
2. User data (the currently authenticated user)
3. Location-specific data (like user language or locale)

## What problems does React context solve?

React context helps us avoid the problem of props drilling.

Props drilling is a term to describe when you pass props down multiple levels to a nested component, through components that don't need it.

```
export default function App({ theme }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Header theme={theme} />
      <Main theme={theme} />
      <Sidebar theme={theme} />
      <Footer theme={theme} />
    </>
  );
}

function Header({ theme }) {
  return (
    <>
      <User theme={theme} />
      <Login theme={theme} />
      <Menu theme={theme} />
    </>
  );
}
```

## How do I use React context?

Context is an API that is built into React, starting from React version 16.
