## Permissions

Permission checks are always run at the very start of the view, before any other code is allowed to proceed. 

Permissions are used to grant or deny access for different classes of users to different parts of the API.

## How permissions are determined around

Permissions in REST framework are always defined as a list of permission classes.

When the permissions checks fail either a "403 Forbidden" or a "401 Unauthorized" response will be returned, according to the following rules:

1. The request was successfully authenticated
2. The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does not use WWW-Authenticate headers
3. The request was not successfully authenticated, and the highest priority authentication class does use WWW-Authenticate headers.


## Object level permissions

REST framework permissions also support object-level permissioning.

Object level permissions are used to determine if a user should be allowed to act on a particular object, which will typically be a model instance.

Object level permissions are run by REST framework's generic views when .get_object() is called.

```
def get_object(self):
    obj = get_object_or_404(self.get_queryset(), pk=self.kwargs["pk"])
    self.check_object_permissions(self.request, obj)
    return obj
```

## Setting the permission policy

The default permission policy may be set globally, using the DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES setting. For example.

```
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'rest_framework.permissions.IsAuthenticated',
    ]
}
```
You can also set the authentication policy on a per-view, or per-viewset basis, using the APIView class-based views.


```
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated
from rest_framework.response import Response
from rest_framework.views import APIView

class ExampleView(APIView):
    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get(self, request, format=None):
        content = {
            'status': 'request was permitted'
        }
        return Response(content)
```
