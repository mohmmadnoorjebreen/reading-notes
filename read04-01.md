## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

### Big O  

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Big O common orders of growth:

1- O(1) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time  

2- O(N) :  grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

3- O(NÂ²) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

4- O(2^N) : growth doubles with each addition to the input data set

### Logarithms  

Programmers use logarithms to shorten the computer programming process.

Binary logarithms can be used to calculate the length of the representation of a number in the binary numeral system.

## Names and Values in Python

In Python, we say that names refer to values, or a name is a reference to a value:

`x = 23`

Many names can refer to one value:

```
x = 23
y = x
```
Names are reassigned independently

```
x = 23
y = x
x = 12
```

Assignment never copies data

```
nums = [1, 2, 3]
other = nums
```

For loops 

```
for x in sequence:
    something(x)
```
