# Linked Lists

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.

each Node references the next Node in the link.

Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has.

## What does it look like

## Traversal 

The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately.

The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null

When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end.

## Traversal Big O

The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n).

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1).

## Adding O(1) 

Here are the required steps to add a new node with an O(1) efficiency.

1- We can then instantiate the new node that we are adding.

2- newNode.Next by default is set to null.

3 - we want to re-assign Head to point at newNode

# Linear data structures

One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed

## Memory management

Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.

## Parts of a linked list 

A linked list is made up of a series of nodes

## What’s a Linked List, Anyway? [Part 2]

## Hey, so, what even is Big O? 

There are two major points to consider when thinking about how an algorithm performs: how much time it requires at runtime given how much time and memory it needs.

One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

## Growing a linked list 

Inserting an element at the beginning of a linked list is particularly nice and efficient because it takes the same amount of time, no matter how long our list is, which is to say it has a space time complexity that is constant, or O(1).
