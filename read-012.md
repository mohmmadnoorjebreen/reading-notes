Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

| SQL	      | NoSQL |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases      | NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational        |
| SQL databases are table based databases whereas   | NoSQL databases are document based        |
| SQL databases represent data in form of tables which consists of n number of rows of data whereas   | NoSQL databases are the collection of key-value pair, documents        |
| SQL databases have predefined schema whereas   | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.        |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas   | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable        |


## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

- the complex query intensive environment whereas

- heavy duty transactional type applications

## Give a real world example.

MySQL Community Edition
## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

-  the hierarchical data storage

## Give a real world example.

## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

## Which type of database is best for scalability?

In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable.

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
