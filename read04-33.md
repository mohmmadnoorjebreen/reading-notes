## What is JSON Web Token?

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

### When should you use JSON Web Tokens?

1. Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT
2. Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties

### What is the JSON Web Token structure?

1. Header
2. Payload
3. Signature

### How do JSON Web Tokens work?

In authentication, when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web Token will be returned.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## DRF JWT Authentication

JWT stand for JSON Web Token and it is an authentication strategy used by client/server applications where the client is a Web application using JavaScript and some frontend framework like Angular, React or VueJS.

The JWT is just an authorization token that should be included in all requests:

The JWT is acquired by exchanging an username + password for an access token and an refresh token.

Those are three distinctive parts that compose a JWT:

`header.payload.signature`

header
```
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "HS256"
}
```

payload
```
{
  "token_type": "access",
  "exp": 1543828431,
  "jti": "7f5997b7150d46579dc2b49167097e7b",
  "user_id": 1
}
```

signature

The signature is issued by the JWT backend

## Django Runserver Is Not Your Production Server

Youâ€™ve built your Django web app and are working on deploying it.

So the server started with runserver is not guaranteed to be performant 

### A Production Stack


You want to only use tech in production, which is reliable, well tested and has been around for a while.

When a request arrives at your server, it should be passed to a dedicated web server.

### How Does Django Fit In?
Your Django app does not actually run as you would think a server would - waiting for requests and reacting to them.
