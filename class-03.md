## Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

HTML provides us with three different types:

1. Ordered lists `<ol>`

2. Unordered lists `<ul>`

3. Definition lists

### Ordered lists

created with
the `<ol>` element.

Ordered lists use numbers.

```
<ol>
<li>Chop potatoes into quarters</li>
<li>Simmer in salted water for 15-20
minutes until tender</li>
<li>Heat milk, butter and nutmeg</li>
<li>Drain potatoes and mash</li>
<li>Mix in the milk mixture</li>
</ol>
```

### Unordered lists

is created
with the `<ul>` element.

Unordered lists use bullets.

```
<ul>
<li>1kg King Edward potatoes</li>
<li>100ml milk</li>
<li>50g salted butter</li>
<li>Freshly grated nutmeg</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
</ul>
```

### Definition Lists

is created with
the `<dl>` element.

Definition lists are used to define terminology.

```
<dl>
<dt>Sashimi</dt>
<dd>Sliced raw fish that is served with
condiments such as shredded daikon radish or
ginger root, wasabi and soy sauce</dd>
<dt>Scale</dt>
<dd>A device used to accurately measure the
weight of ingredients</dd>
<dd>A technique by which the scales are removed
from the skin of a fish</dd>
<dt>Scamorze</dt>
<dt>Scamorzo</dt>
<dd>An Italian cheese usually made from whole
cow's milk (although it was traditionally made
from buffalo milk)</dd>
</dl>
```

## Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

CSS treats each HTML
element as if it lives in its own box.

### Box Dimensions

To
set your own dimensions for a
box you can use the height and
width properties.

![Box Dimensions](https://datacadamia.com/_media/web/css/box/css_box_size_content.png)

Control the shape of the elements when the screen is reduced and enlarged, we use:

* Limiting Width

* Limiting Height

### Border, Margin & Padding

## Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)

### ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable.

You create an array and give it
a name just like you would any
other variable.

```
var colors;
colors ['white', 'black', ' custom '];
var el = document.getElementByld('col ors');
el . textContent = col ors[O];
```

**note: we prefer use let & const**

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)

### SWITCH STATEMENTS

A switch statement starts with a
variable called the switch value.

![SWITCH STATEMENTS](https://www.theengineeringprojects.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Switch-Statment-in-JavaScript-1.jpg)

code that should run if the
variable matches that value.

You have a default option that is run if
none of the cases match.
