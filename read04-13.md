# How to Run Linear Regression in Python

Scikit-learn is a powerful Python module for machine learning.

## Exploring Boston Housing Data Set

The first step is to import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.

This data set is available in sklearn Python module, so I will access it using scikitlearn

The object boston is a dictionary, so you can explore the keys of this dictionary.

I am going to print the feature names of boston data set.

I am going to convert boston.data into a pandas data frame.

## Scikit Learn

import linear regression from sci-kit learn module.

Important functions to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are:
```
lm.fit() -> fits a linear model

lm.predict() -> Predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
```


## Fitting a Linear Model

I am going to use all 13 parameters to fit a linear regression model. Two other parameters that you can pass to linear regression object are fit_intercept and normalize.

As you can see from the data frame that there is a high correlation between RM and prices. Lets plot a scatter plot between True housing prices and True RM.

## Training and validation data sets

n practice you wont implement linear regression on the entire data set, you will have to split the data sets into training and test data sets.
