# Django Forms

## HTML Forms 

The form is defined in HTML as a collection of elements inside `<form>...</form>` tags, containing at least one input element of type="submit".

```
<form action="/team_name_url/" method="post">
    <label for="team_name">Enter name: </label>
    <input id="team_name" type="text" name="name_field" value="Default name for team.">
    <input type="submit" value="OK">
</form>
```

## Django form handling process
A process flowchart of how Django handles form requests is shown below, starting with a request for a page containing a form (shown in green).

![](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Forms/form_handling_-_standard.png)

the main things that Django's form handling does are:

1. Display the default form the first time it is requested by the user.

2. Receive data from a submit request and bind it to the form.
3. Clean and validate the data
4. If any data is invalid, re-display the form, this time with any user populated values and error messages for the problem fields.
5. If all data is valid, perform required actions 
6. Once all actions are complete, redirect the user to another page.

## Renew-book form using a Form and function view

The Form class is the heart of Django's form handling system.

The declaration syntax for a Form is very similar to that for declaring a Model.

```
from django import forms

class RenewBookForm(forms.Form):
    renewal_date = forms.DateField(help_text="Enter a date between now and 4 weeks (default 3).")
```
