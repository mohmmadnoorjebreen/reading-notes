# Dunder Methods

## What Are Dunder Methods? 
In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes.

These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” 

```
class NoLenSupport:
    pass

>>> obj = NoLenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
TypeError: "object of type 'NoLenSupport' has no len()"
```
using dunders 
```
class LenSupport:
    def __len__(self):
        return 42

>>> obj = LenSupport()
>>> len(obj)
42
```

## Special Methods and the Python Data Model
This elegant design is known as the Python data model.

You can see Python’s data model as a powerful API you can interface with by implementing one or more dunder methods.

## Object Initialization: __init__

To construct account objects from the Account class I need a constructor which in Python is the __init__ dunder:

```
class Account:
    """A simple account class"""

    def __init__(self, owner, amount=0):
        """
        This is the constructor that lets us create
        objects from this class
        """
        self.owner = owner
        self.amount = amount
        self._transactions = []
```

## Object Representation: __str__, __repr__

`__repr__`: The “official” string representation of an object.

`__str__`: The “informal” or nicely printable string representation of an object. 

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __repr__(self):
        return 'Account({!r}, {!r})'.format(self.owner, self.amount)

    def __str__(self):
        return 'Account of {} with starting amount: {}'.format(
            self.owner, self.amount)
```

## Iteration: __len__, __getitem__, __reversed__

In order to iterate over our account object I need to add some transactions.

```
def add_transaction(self, amount):
    if not isinstance(amount, int):
        raise ValueError('please use int for amount')
    self._transactions.append(amount)
```
Dunder methods to the rescue! It only takes a little bit of code to make the class iterable:

```
class Account:
    # ... (see above)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self._transactions)

    def __getitem__(self, position):
        return self._transactions[position]
```
To iterate over transactions in reversed order you can implement the __reversed__ special method:

```
def __reversed__(self):
    return self[::-1]

>>> list(reversed(acc))
[30, -20, 50, -10, 20]
```

# Statistics - Probability

## What is probability?

probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?

## From statistics to probability

First, the data confirm that our average number of heads does approach what probability suggests it should be. 

## The data and the distribution

The normal distribution refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics. The normal distribution looks like this:

he most important qualities to notice about the normal distribution is its symmetry and its shape. 

In a probability context, the high point in a normal distribution represents the event with the highest probability of occurring. As you get farther away from this event on either side
