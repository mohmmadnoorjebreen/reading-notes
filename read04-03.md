# Read & Write Files in Python

## What Is a File? 

a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data

Files are composed of three main parts:

1- Header: metadata about the contents of the file

2- Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor


3- End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

## File Paths 

The file path is a string that represents the location of a file.

three major parts of paths:

1- Folder Path

2- File Name

3- Extension

```
/
│
├── path/
|   │
│   ├── to/
│   │   └── cats.gif
│   │
│   └── dog_breeds.txt
|
└── animals.csv
```

## Line Endings

line endings should use the sequence of the Carriage Return (CR or \r) and the Line Feed (LF or \n) characters (CR+LF or \r\n).

## Opening and Closing a File in Python

When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it.

`file = open('dog_breeds.txt')`

It’s important to remember that it’s your responsibility to close the file. 

## Text File Types

A text file is the most common file that you’ll encounter. 

```
open('abc.txt')

open('abc.txt', 'r')

open('abc.txt', 'w')
```

# Python Exceptions: An Introduction
In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception.
# Exceptions versus Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement.

```
>>> print( 0 / 0 ))
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    print( 0 / 0 ))
                  ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
## Raising an Exception

We can use raise to throw an exception if a condition occurs. 

```
x = 10
if x > 5:
    raise Exception('x should not exceed 5. The value of x was: {}'.format(x))
```

## The AssertionError Exception

We assert that a certain condition is met

```
import sys
assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "This code runs on Linux only."
```

## The try and except Block: Handling Exceptions

The try and except block in Python is used to catch and handle exceptions.

```
def linux_interaction():
    assert ('linux' in sys.platform), "Function can only run on Linux systems."
    print('Doing something.')
```
