# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack 

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is:

- Push

- Pop 

- Top 

- Peek 

- IsEmpty 

Stacks follow these concepts:

FILO

This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

LIFO

This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## Push O(1)

Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack.

```
ALOGORITHM push(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   node.next <-- Top
   top <-- Node
```
## Pop O(1)   

Popping a Node off a stack is the action of removing a Node from the top.

Typically, you would check isEmpty before conducting a pop. This will ensure that an exception is not raised. Alternately, you can wrap the call in a try/catch block.

```
ALGORITHM pop()
// INPUT <-- No input
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   Node temp <-- top
   top <-- top.next
   temp.next <-- null
   return temp.value
```

## Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the top Node of the stack.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

   return top.value
```

## IsEmpty O(1)

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return top = NULL
```

# What is a Queue

## Common terminology for a queue is

- Enqueue 

- Dequeue  

- Front  

- Rear  

- Peek  

- IsEmpty 

FIFO
This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

LILO
This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

## Enqueue O(1)

When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation.

```
ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
// OUTPUT <-- none
   node = new Node(value)
   rear.next <-- node
   rear <-- node
```

## Dequeue O(1)

When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation.

## Peek O(1)

When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.

```
ALGORITHM peek()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty

   return front.value
```   

IsEmpty O(1)

```
ALGORITHM isEmpty()
// INPUT <-- none
// OUTPUT <-- boolean

return front = NULL
```
