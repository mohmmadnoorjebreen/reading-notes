## A Beginner's Guide to Docker

This is a beginnerâ€™s guide to Docker which is a way to isolate and run entire applications.

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization.

Virtual environments are used to isolate Python software packages locally.

Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker. 

```
$ docker-compose --version
docker-compose version 1.24.1, build 4667896b
```
Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir code && cd code
$ mkdir python3.7 && cd python3.7
```
## Library Website and API

Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. 

The most important takeaway is that Django creates websites containing webpages, while Django REST Framework creates web APIs which are a collection of URL endpoints containing available HTTP verbs that return JSON.
### Django REST Framework

Django REST Framework is added just like any other third-party app. Make sure to quit the local server Control + c if it is still running. 

`(library) $ pipenv install djangorestframework~=3.11.0`

Add it to the INSTALLED_APPS config in our settings.py file.
```
# config/settings.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',

    # 3rd party
    'rest_framework', # new

    # Local
    'books',
]
```

differences between traditional Django and Django REST Framework. 

1. URLs
2. Views
3. Serializers
4. cURL
5. Browsable API
