# List Comprehensions in Python

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists.

The list comprehension always returns a result list.

If you used to do it like this:

```
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))
```

You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension. 

```
new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]
```

## Syntax
The list comprehension starts with a ‘[‘ && ‘]’

`[ expression for item in list if conditional ]`

This is equivalent to:
```
for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression
```

then 

`new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]`

## Create a simple list

```
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x
```

## Create a list using loops and list comprehension

`squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]`

## Multiplying parts of a list
Multiply every part of a list by three and assign it to a new list.


```
list1 = [3,4,5]
 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] 
```

## Show the first letter of each word

We will take the first letter of each word and make a list out of it.

```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
```

## Lower/Upper case converter

Let’s show how easy you can convert lower case / upper case letters.

```
>>> [x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']

>>> [x.upper() for x in ["a","b","c"]]
['A', 'B', 'C']
```

## Print numbers only from a given string
This example show how to extract all the numbers from a string.

```
string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers

>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```

## Parsing a file using list comprehension

Create a text file and put in some text in it.

```
fh = open("test.txt", "r")

result = [i for i in fh if "line3" in i]

print result
```
