# Classes and Objects

Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")
```

## Accessing Object Variables

To access the variable inside of the newly created object

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.variable
```
## Accessing Object Functions

To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable:

```
class MyClass:
    variable = "blah"

    def function(self):
        print("This is a message inside the class.")

myobjectx = MyClass()

myobjectx.function()
```
# Thinking Recursively in Python

## Dear Pythonic Santa Claus…

 algorithm for delivering presents is based on an explicit loop construction, it is called an iterative algorithm.

![](https://files.realpython.com/media/santa_claus_2.ecbf2686f1a1.png) 

```
houses = ["Eric's house", "Kenny's house", "Kyle's house", "Stan's house"]

def deliver_presents_iteratively():
    for house in houses:
        print("Delivering presents to", house)
```

algorithm with which he can divide the work of delivering presents among his elves:

## Recursive Functions in Python
 A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.

 All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

```
def factorial_recursive(n):
    # Base case: 1! = 1
    if n == 1:
        return 1

    # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!
    else:
        return n * factorial_recursive(n-1)
```

## Maintaining State

to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

1- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context

2- Keep the state in global scope

# Pytest Fixtures and Coverage

## Fixtures

Those objects might contain data you want to share across tests, or they might involve the network or filesystem. These are often known as "fixtures" in the testing world,

```
def reverse_lines(f):
   return [one_line.rstrip()[::-1] + '\n'
           for one_line in f]
```

## Coverage 

you'll get a coverage report for every part of the Python library that your program used, so I strongly suggest you provide an argument to --cov
